## Hello there!

I'm Diego,

a passionate senior software engineer, born and raised in Italy 🇮🇹, currently living in Belgium 🇧🇪

I enjoy writing software using primarily [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) and functional effect systems such as
[ZIO](https://zio.dev).

<details>
<summary>Why Scala?</summary>
Because it's a statically typed, concise, expressive, JVM-based language(*), that allows you to program in
both imperative and functional styles. It's the ideal language to onboard junior SWEs into a one that is less
cumbersome and requires less boilerplate than Java, while still being able to leverage all the libraries and frameworks
from the Java ecosystem. It makes functional programming paradigms available in a non-intrusive way, giving the
developer the choice to mix and match the two styles as they are most comfortable with.

(*) although there are projects like [scala-js](https://www.scala-js.org/)
and [scala-native](https://scala-native.org/en/latest/) that bring Scala respectively to the Web and bare-metal world.

<details>
<summary>Why ZIO?</summary>
Because we live in an increasingly cloud-based world, where it is critical to write high-performance,
resilient, concurrent and asynchronous applications. ZIO enabled developers to seamlessly write concurrent and
asynchronous code with little overhead, by composing easy-to-understand simple building blocks. Say goodbye using
<code>Future</code>, <code>ReentrantLock</code> or <code>Semaphore</code>, and focus instead of what matters the most for your business.

### OpenSource projects

I [am plagued](https://x.com/polentino911/status/1292858752924819462) by the "having more ideas than free time"
syndrome: I start a project, reach a point where I get the gist of it, then lose interest because "I know how to get
there, if I need it" 🥲

However, in the past years, I began to force myself into completing the projects I started, such as:

* [redacted](https://github.com/polentino/redacted), a Scala `3.x` and `2.x` compiler plugin that prevents leaking
  sensitive fields defined inside case classes. Just annotate them with `@redacted` and boom, no more `email`, `age`,
  `apiKey` or any other PII/GDPR related data will be printed by mistake in a log or serialised into a response. It is
  used in the Company I'm currently working with, [InvestSuite](https://www.investsuite.com/).
    * [sbt-redacted](https://github.com/polentino/sbt-redacted/), the plugin for [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) that
      does all the project configuration for you, setting the compiler plugin and injecting the correct dependencies.
* [neovim-idea](https://github.com/neovim-idea/neovim-idea): a highly customized [neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup that
  is aimed to resemble the UI/UX [IntellIJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) as much as possible, with a focus on
  Scala and Java development.

On the scrapes of leftover time, I like to review technical books at [Manning](https://www.manning.com), and also try to
contribute back to OSS by submitting patches and improvements.
